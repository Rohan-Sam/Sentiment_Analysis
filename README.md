# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews

This project is a simple sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. The goal is to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, which contains over 130 million customer reviews across various product categories. For this project, we will use a small subset of this dataset containing reviews for a specific product.

## Preprocessing

Before we can analyze the sentiment of each review, we need to preprocess the text data to remove any noise and irrelevant information. The following preprocessing steps are applied to each review:

1. **Lowercase:** Convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
2. **Tokenization:** Split the text into individual words or tokens.
3. **Stopword Removal:** Remove common stop words such as "a", "an", "the", etc. that do not carry much meaning.
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduce each word to its root form to remove any variations (e.g., "running" -> "run").

## Feature Extraction

Once the data is preprocessed, we need to extract features from the text that can be used to train a machine learning model. The following feature extraction methods are commonly used in sentiment analysis:

1. **Bag of Words (BoW):** Represent each review as a vector of word counts, where each element of the vector represents the frequency of a specific word in the review.
2. **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** Similar to BoW, but also takes into account the frequency of each word across all reviews in the dataset to reduce the impact of common words.

## Model Training

Once the features are extracted, we can train a machine learning model to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral. The following models are commonly used in sentiment analysis:

1. **Naive Bayes:** A simple probabilistic model that calculates the likelihood of a review being positive, negative, or neutral based on the frequency of each word in the review.
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A more complex model that uses a kernel function to separate the data into different classes based on the extracted features.
3. **Deep Learning Models:** More recently, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of our sentiment analysis model, we can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We can also visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Conclusion

Sentiment analysis is a useful technique for analyzing customer feedback and understanding the overall sentiment towards a product or service. By following the basic pipeline of preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, we can build an effective sentiment analysis system.
